## Notes:
- All blocks, where appropriate, are oriented "down" or to the "outside" (e.g. doors open in; swing is up).
- The unit of measure is inches and are drawn full-scale.
- All block geometery is on the "0" layer.
- The pen attributes are 'By Layer'.  When blocks are inserted they adopt the pen attributes of the current layer.

A template, "BlockTmpl.dxf", is included for adding your own blocks or for anyone who would like to contribute.
The drawing geometry is on the "0" layer.  Dimensions are optional.
